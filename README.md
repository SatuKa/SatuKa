What you will find :arrow_right: Java, Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, R, SQL, SAS

Most of my projects are school assignments 
(detailed information about the assignments can be found in the readme). The hardest thing i studied was assembly :dizzy_face: 
I still don't understand how it works and i may not dare to open that repo to you.
In addition, here are a few tutorials / works i have done on workshops (please see readme for details). There is nothing miraculous about them 
but thanks to them I find that I have developed enormously. 
Thanks to school assignments and workshops, i can soon publish my own projects.
